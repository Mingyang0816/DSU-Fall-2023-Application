# F1 Data Analysis

Using a Kaggle dataset on F1 drivers, I performed some basic data analysis and answered the following questions:
1. Which driver won the most races?
2. Which country has the most championships?
3. Which driver won the highest proportion of races they competed in?
4. Which driver participated in the most seasons?

Following that, I performed in-depth analysis on the following questions while acknowledging the limitations of my analysis:
1. Do drivers who start in pole position usually win the race?
2. Which is the most competitive decade?
